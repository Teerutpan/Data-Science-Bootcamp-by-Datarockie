## Data Science Bootcamp Batch 10 by Datarockie
After completing Google Data Analytics Certificate and Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate from Coursera. I learned further data science courses on websites and youtube flatform.<br />

On 1 June 2024, I applied for the six months intensive data science bootcamp in Thailand. This is one of the most comprehensive and friendly data science bootcamp on earth by "adToy" ***Kasidis Satangmongkol*** [https://bootcamp.datarockie.com](url) founder of Datarockie.com and Data Science Bootcamp in Thailand.
### The content of Intensive Data Science Bootcamp includes the following topics below
- Intro to Data Science
- Building a Second Brain
- Spreadsheets [Click to find all google sheet projects below](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1670CpeqEGAJ4t_ECbaki4bh-8GbPUcVpy9yAd2e6eW4/edit?gid=151074853#gid=151074853)
  - Using Google sheets tools such as function, formula, conditional formatting, query, and regular expression for data management, analysis and find insight from data. 
    - Project - Filter employee's gender and performance and also sort by salary
    - Project - Color highlight on employee data using conditional formatting
    - Project - Querying and summarizing employee data
    - Project - Enriching the Data using VLOOKUP and arrayformula
    - Project - Convert Thai to English date
    - Project - ID Card Parser using regular expression
- Databases SQL
    - Project - Create restaurant database using SQL ( [SQL coding](https://replit.com/@teerutpan/homeworksqldsb10essan#main.sql)  and  [DBdiagram](https://github.com/Teerutpan/Data-Science-Bootcamp-by-Datarockie/assets/152750283/900fcb69-496e-42c0-a144-15b0a8f10843) )
        - Using SQL to create a restaurant database, start from create table, insert data into the table, verify all data in the table, using commands to get inside from the data like ‘with, join, group by, order by and more, using aggregate functions to find statistical values and create db diagram to show relation between each table.

- R Programming Foundation
    - Project - Create 'Pao Ying Chub' game [R coding](https://github.com/Teerutpan/Data-Science-Bootcamp-by-Datarockie/blob/main/pao_ying_chup_game.R)
       - Using R studio to build a game, start from creating a dataframe, set parameters, using while loop to determine the number of the game and check data input from user, using if clause to build the game role condition and summarizing the game result.
         
    - Project - Chatbot to order pizza  [R coding](https://github.com/Teerutpan/Data-Science-Bootcamp-by-Datarockie/blob/main/chatbot_order_pizza.R)
       - Using R studio to build a chatbot to order pizza, start from creating a new function, create vector and dataframe, using while loop and readline function to get input from user and check if it’s in a database, using if clause to match the data condition.
         
    - Project - Create restaurant database using R studio  [R coding](https://github.com/Teerutpan/Data-Science-Bootcamp-by-Datarockie/blob/main/create_restaurant_database.R)
       - Using R studio to create a restaurant database, start from install and load library of used packages, using dbConnect to create database and open connection, create table from data.frame, using dbWriteTable to write table into the database, using dbListTables to check table in the database, using dbListFields to check column name in the table, using  dbGetQuery to get data from the table and using dbDisconnect to close the connection.

- Data Transformation
    - Project - Data Transformation by "dplyr"  [R coding](https://github.com/Teerutpan/Data-Science-Bootcamp-by-Datarockie/blob/main/data_transformation_nycflights13.R)
       - Using core functions in dplyr to make data manipulation to find some inside in dataset "nycflights13" in R studio packages.
         
- Data Visualization
    - Project - Create Data Visualization using ggplot2 in R [R Markdown](https://github.com/Teerutpan/Data-Science-Bootcamp-by-Datarockie/blob/main/Data%20Viz%20by%20ggplot2.pdf)
       - Creating R Markdown consists of 5 data visualization charts created by ggplot2. First, I load the library(tidyverse), and prepare data by using sample data of diamonds in R packages. Create a histogram to find the distribution of diamonds by price. Create a bar chart to find the total number of diamond’s quality of cut on each diamond’s clarity. Create a scatter plot to find diamonds’ relation between carat and price divided by quality of cut. Create a box plot to find the distribution of diamonds' cut quality across carat and create a heat map to find between carat and price. After creating the initial visualization charts, we found it easier to understand our data, and were able to find relationships and derive insights from the data.

- Statistics for Data Analyst
- Essential Economics
- Website Building with Wordpress
  
- Looker Studio Dashboard
    - Project - Project - Create Dashboard in Looker Studio [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/b7311e74-548f-430f-9ce6-e24ee03281a2/page/pgT9D?s=hPQZoVMkZVw)
      - Using Looker Studio to create three dashboards consists of overall sales, product performance, and customer detail by using "store.csv" dataset. First, connect the data from store.csv in google sheet. Second, create an impactful report and dashboard and finally, share these reports and dashboards with stakeholders. The key concept of dashboard tools like Looker Studio, Tableau and Power BI is the same: connect, create and share. After you already learn one tool you can apply the method to another tool.
