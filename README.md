## Data Science Bootcamp Batch 10 by Datarockie
After completing Google Data Analytics Certificate and Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate from Coursera. I learned further data science courses on websites and youtube flatform.<br />

On 1 June 2024, I applied for the six months intensive data science bootcamp in Thailand.
